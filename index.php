<h2>Hi There!</h2>

<p>My name is John Deerhake and I am a <?php echo myage(); ?> year old web developer currently living in Boston and working for BL Trading of Hanover, Massachusetts. My specialties are PHP and front-end 
	development with CSS, valid XHTML Strict, Javascript, and jQuery; however I have experience with Perl, Python, and Ruby as well.</p>
<p>I have experience developing in both Windows and Linux environments, and using Git, Mercurial, and SVN version control.  Most of my development experience so far has been as a one man
	band, but I do enjoy working with other developers as part of a team.</p>
