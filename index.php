<h2>Hi There!</h2>

<p>My name is John Deerhake and I am a <?php echo myage(); ?> year old front-end web developer currently living in Pasadena, California and working for <a href="http://www.goldstar.com">Goldstar.com</a>. I love writing good, reusable ECMAScript (erm.. Javascript) and I enjoy some CSS and (X)HTML as well.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to go camping, hiking, ride my bike, cook, and throw discus. The picture on the right is my girlfriend Laura and I in the white mountains in New Hampshire.</p>
