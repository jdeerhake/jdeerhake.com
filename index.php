<h2>Hi There!</h2>

<p>My name is John Deerhake and I am a <?php echo myage(); ?> year old front-end web developer currently living in Pasadena, California and working for <a href="http://www.goldstar.com">Goldstar.com</a>. I love writing Javascript and making the web faster.  I also enjoy writing some CSS and HTML fromt time to time.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to go camping, hiking, ride my bike, cook, and throw discus. The pictures on this site are random pulls from my Flickr stream that represent a lot of the things I enjoying doing while not working.</p>
