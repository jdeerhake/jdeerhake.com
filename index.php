<h2>Hi There!</h2>

<p>My name is John Deerhake and I am a front end web developer currently living in Santa Monica and working for <a href="https://travo.com">TRAVO</a>. I love writing Javascript and making the web faster.  I also enjoy writing some CSS and HTML fromt time to time.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to travel, go camping & hiking, and am an aspiring triathlete. The pictures on this site are random pulls from my Flickr stream that represent a lot of the things I enjoying doing while not sitting at a computer.</p>
