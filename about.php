<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I grew up outside the small town of LaFayette, Ohio (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Lafayette,+OH&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=84.512694,185.449219&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Lafayette,+Allen,+Ohio&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A">where?</a>).
	After graduating from high school I moved to Columbus and attended Ohio State.  While taking classes I worked multiple part time jobs simultaneously including working as an
	<a href="http://www.homecityice.com">ice delivery man</a>, <a href="http://www.uaschools.org/index.aspx?nid=155">jr. high track coach</a>, and as an
	IT professional.</p>

<p>I like to travel as much as I can, I've driven through and visited about 35 US states and 9 countries in Europe. Since growing up in Ohio, I've lived for short periods of time in Glendale, California;
	Darmstadt-Wixhausen, Germany; Hanover, New Hampshire; Boston, Massachusetts; and Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>I got my first computer in 1996 - a Gateway2000 with a Pentium Pro 180 MHz. I instanly began playing around with it and almost just as quickly broke it.  After I repeated this process once
	or twice I decided to teach myself to fix it.  I've been fixing computers (and breaking them) ever since.  I've also taken to building and upgrading them as a hobby.</p>

<p>In the midst of that experience I was introduced to coding by my cousin, Dustin.  I started with QBasic in 1996 and that led me to C and C++. Around that same year, I made my first
	webpage using HTML and instantly loved web programming. </p>
